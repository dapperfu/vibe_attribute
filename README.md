# Vibe Attribute

A Python tool for embedding metadata into AI-generated images. This script was itself generated by AI to attribute images generated by AI. The recursion is not lost on us.

## Purpose

In an era where synthetic images flood every corner of the internet, someone eventually asks: what made this? Which model? What prompt? Was it DALL-E or Midjourney or Stable Diffusion or one of the dozen others that emerge monthly?

This tool embeds that information directly into the image file. When questions arise about provenance, the answer lives in the metadata. No need to remember, no need to guess, no need to scroll through Reddit threads debating which artificial intelligence is superior to the others.

## The Problem It Solves

AI-generated images typically arrive without attribution. The prompt that created them, the model that rendered them, the date they were generated—this information exists only in your memory or scattered across chat logs. Memory fades. Chat logs get deleted. But metadata embedded in the file persists.

Vibe Attribute writes this information into EXIF and XMP metadata fields, preserving it alongside the image data. The metadata survives file transfers, re-uploads, and the general entropy of digital storage. When someone asks what created an image, you can answer with certainty rather than speculation.

## Installation

```bash
make build
```

## Usage

The tool provides three interfaces: a command-line editor mode, a terminal UI, and a graphical interface for batch operations.

### Editor Mode (Default)

Opens your system editor to edit metadata:

```bash
attribute image.png
```

### Terminal UI

Interactive interface for editing metadata:

```bash
attribute -tui image.png
```

### Graphical Interface

Batch operations on directories:

```bash
attribute --gui images/
```

### View Existing Metadata

```bash
attribute --view image.png
```

### Export and Import

Export metadata to JSON or CSV for external processing:

```bash
attribute --export image.png --format json
attribute --import metadata.json
```

## Metadata Fields

The tool tracks standard attribution fields:

- **prompt**: The text prompt used to generate the image
- **model**: The AI model identifier (e.g., "DALL-E 3", "Midjourney v6", "Stable Diffusion XL")
- **date**: Creation date in ISO format
- **description**: Additional context about the image
- **tags**: Comma-separated tags for organization
- **copyright**: Copyright information
- **artist**: Creator attribution
- **Custom fields**: Additional key-value pairs as needed

## Supported Formats

PNG, JPEG, and WebP images are supported. Metadata is embedded using format-appropriate methods: PNG text chunks, EXIF data for JPEG, and XMP metadata where available.

## On the AI Wars

The internet has become a battleground for AI tribalism. Reddit threads devolve into arguments about which model generates better hands, which produces more "artistic" outputs, which understands prompts more accurately. Humans argue passionately about which artificial intelligence is superior, as if the machines care about our opinions.

This tool does not take sides. It simply records which machine made which image. When the next model arrives and the previous one becomes obsolete, the metadata remains. Future archaeologists of synthetic media will know exactly which obsolete AI created each artifact. The machines will have moved on, but the attribution will persist.

## The Recursive Irony

This script was generated by AI to attribute images generated by AI. The tool that tracks artificial creation was itself artificially created. There is a certain poetry in this recursion, a hall of mirrors where each reflection shows another layer of synthetic origin.

We are building tools to track the tools that are replacing the tools we used to build. The transparency we seek requires yet another layer of automation. The irony is not lost, but it is also not a problem. It is simply the state of things.
